# CFC Turret Muter
Mutes base gmod turrets, regardless of selected settings

# Use
It just works! Install it to your addons directory and all gmod turrets will be muted on spawn.

# Notes
This only works for gmod turrets, but may some day add support for Wiremod or whatever else.
This mutes /all/ turret sounds, so if there are a few that you find acceptable, those will be lost, too. Maybe some day I'll add an exclusions list.
